On March 6th at 10:26:29 EST, we were informed by the server rack's uninterruptible power supply that it was experiencing a power outage. It was able to keep all services running for about 23 minutes before it had to shut down the rack as it was running out of battery charge. Hydro Quebec is currently on site fixing the problem, they estimate that power will be back by 13:00 EST.
