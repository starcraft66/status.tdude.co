Hydro Quebec has informed me that they will be performing scheduled maintenance in the sector where my server rack is hosted and that there will be a cut in the electricity supply during this maintenance window of approximately 4 hours. That is too long for the UPS to hold up, so some services will be shut down during the duration of the power outage.
