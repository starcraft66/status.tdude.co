Hydro Quebec has informed me that they will be performing scheduled maintenance in the sector where my server rack is hosted and that there will be a cut in the electricity supply during this maintenance window of approximately 4 hours (starting March 4th at 8AM EST). That is too long for the UPS to hold up, so some services will be shut down during the duration of the power outage.

::: update Status Update | 2018-03-04T17:00:00.000Z
We have been informed that the maintenance has been extended until 13:15 EST.
